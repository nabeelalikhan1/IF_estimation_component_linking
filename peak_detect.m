function peaks = peak_detect(tfd,thresh)
% Usage:    peaks = Peak_TFD(tfd,[thresh])
%   
%   Inputs: tfd ~ The time-frequency representation where local peaks are 
%                 to be found
%           thresh ~ percentage of tfd maximum local peaks must be above
%                    to be considered a valid peak. Default = 0.5
%
%   Outputs: peaks ~ a binary image indicating the located peaks
%
% Notes: This function finds the local peaks in the time frequency 
%        representation which are a above a predetermined threshold
